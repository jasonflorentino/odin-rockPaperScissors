# 🗿 Rock! 📄 Paper! ✂️ Scissors!

Spurred on in doing the Odin Project, I made this Rock Paper Scissors game as my first project that hooks up HTML and CSS with JavaScript programming and DOM manipulation. To make it more interesting and fun to play with, I wanted to create a visual aspect to choosing your "character" that also served as a way to quickly see the result of the game. This involved figuring out a way to place the elements as well as animate them with JavaScript.

As my first project, I'm sure there are cleaner ways to implement the functionalities and animations here. I can't wait to learn them and revisit this code later on to see how I've grown.

Best wishes,
